# X-Education---Lead-Scoring-Case-Study
X Education sells online courses to industry professionals The company markets its courses on several websites like Google. Once these people land on the website, they might browse the courses or fill up a form for the course or watch some videos When these people fill up a form providing their email address or phone number, they are classified to be a lead Once these leads are acquired, employees from the sales team start making calls, writing emails, etc. Through this process, some of the leads get converted while most do not.

This educational industry gets a lot of leads, but its lead conversion rate is very poor. (about 30%) 
To make this process more efficient, the company wishes to identify the most potential leads, also known as 'Hot Leadâ€™s'.
If they successfully identify this set of leads, the lead conversion rate should go up as the sales team will now be focusing more on communicating with the potential leads rather than making calls to everyone.
